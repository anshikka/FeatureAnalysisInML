# Using Feature Elimination/Extraction to Improve ML Models
Based on a Caravan Insurance challenge from Kaggle, we perform analysis by selecting features based on importance, weight, and effect on a model or eliminate features that negatively or negligibly interfere with the model.

### Goals
* Stepwise selection (regression) of features based on p-values
* Principal component analysis using plot and explained variances
* Recursive feature elimination using logistic regression
* Feature importance using a Random Forest Classifier
